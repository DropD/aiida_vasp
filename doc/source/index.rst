Welcome to AiiDA-VASP's documentation!
======================================

AiiDA-VASP is a plug-in for the workflow management and data provenance tracking framework `AiiDA`_. It provides the classes `AiiDA`_ needs to run simulations using `VASP`_ (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package). `VASP`_ is a program for atomic scale materials modelling, e.g. electronic structure calculations and quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics, from first principles. For detailed documentation on using `VASP`_ take a look in their `VASP wiki`_.

AiiDA-VASP is under active development, check out the `changelog`_.

General comments about the user documentation and support
=========================================================

If you already use Python chances are you have a working system to manage your virtual environments. Please note that `AiiDA`_ as well as this plugin are tested with both ``virtualenv``, ``conda`` and ``virtualenvwrapper``. Since Python 2 is soon to be deprecated the documentation are written assuming Python 3.6 or later is present and working. However, `AiiDA`_ and AiiDA-VASP are compatible with Python 2 in case you prefer. If that is the case you should be able to translate the procedures that are different to Python 2. In the documentation we will assume you are working with ``virtualenv``. which is also bundled with Python 3.

Tested with VASP 5.4.4.
